Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29.\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, \"Yes.\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n '\"We don\\'t believe justice was done,\" Weinberg said.\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector\\'s years-long \"pattern of violence\" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict Â»\\n',\n '\\n',\n '\"This was not an isolated incident,\" Fidler said, noting Spector\\'s two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. \"The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn\\'t get any more serious than that.\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n \"Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n \"A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n 'In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector \"a very dangerous man\" who \"has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth.\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n 'Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said.\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict.\\n',\n '\\n',\n '\"This entire jury took this so seriously,\" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that \"it\\'s tough to be in a jury,\" because another person\\'s life is in the jury\\'s hands.\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie \"Barbarian Queen\" and appeared in many other films, including \"DeathStalker,\" \"Blind Date,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and the spoof \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood\\'s House of Blues at the time of her death.\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n 'But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n 'Spector\\'s professional trademark was the \"Wall of Sound,\" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict?\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called \"little symphonies for the kids\" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes\\' \"Be My Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers\\' \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feelin\\'.\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Spector co-produced the Beatles\\' final album, \"Let It Be,\" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison\\'s 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year.\\n',\n '\\n',\n \"Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.\\n\",\n '\\n',\n '@highlight\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'NEW: Defense says it will appeal; \"We don\\'t believe justice was done\"\\n',\n '\\n',\n '@highlight\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Phil Spector guilty of second-degree murder at retrial\\n',\n '\\n',\n '@highlight\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'He faces 15 years to life in prison for shooting death of Lana Clarkson\\n',\n '\\n',\n '@highlight\\n',\n '\\n',\n 'Renowned music producer accused in death of actress in 2003']"

      "text/plain": "e military force in Syria.\\n\\nObama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\"\\n\\nIt's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.\\n\\nThere are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?\\n\\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.\\n\\n\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\"\\n\\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.\\n\\nTranscript: Read Obama's full remarks\\n\\nSyrian crisis: Latest developments\\n\\nU.N. inspectors leave Syria\\n\\nObama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.\\n\\n\"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.\\n\\nBut who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.\\n\\nTop U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.\\n\\nBritish and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.\\n\\nThe inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.\\n\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.\\n\\n\"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said.\\n\\nHe noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\"\\n\\nBergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.\\n\\nObama: 'This menace must be confronted'\\n\\nObama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.\\n\\nSome global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said.\\n\\nSyria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said.\\n\\nA failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\"\\n\\nSyria missile strike: What would happen next?\\n\\nMap: U.S. and allied assets around Syria\\n\\nObama decision came Friday night\\n\\nOn Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers.\\n\\nWhat will happen if they vote no?\\n\\nIt's unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.\\n\\nObama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government.\\n\\nHe spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech.\\n\\n\"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.\\n\\n5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria\\n\\nSyria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror\\n\\nReactions mixed to Obama's speech\\n\\nA spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama's announcement.\\n\\n\"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\"\\n\\nSome members of Congress applauded Obama's decision.\\n\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president.\\n\\n\"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\"\\n\\nMore than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action.\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama's speech in a Twitter post Saturday.\\n\\n\"I understand and support Barack Obama's position on Syria,\" Cameron said.\\n\\nAn influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory.\\n\\n\"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.\\n\\nIn the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday.\\n\\n\"Like many other Americans...we're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration.\\n\\nWhat do Syria's neighbors think?\\n\\nWhy Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad\\n\\nSyria's government unfazed\\n\\nAfter Obama's speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels.\\n\\nSyria's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling.\\n\\n\"The Syrian Army's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama's address.\\n\\nAn anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\"\\n\\nA top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States.\\n\\n\"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations.\\n\\nBoth Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don't know how to get down.\"\\n\\nThe Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.\\n\\nBritish intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.\\n\\nIran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster'\\n\\nOpinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea\\n\\n   \n1  (CNN) -- Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men's 4x100m relay.\\n\\nThe fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds.\\n\\nThe U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover.\\n\\nThe 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles.\\n\\nThe relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital.\\n\\n\"I'm proud of myself and I'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible,\" Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics.\\n\\nVictory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems.\\n\\nGatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt.\\n\\nEarlier, Jamaica's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple.\\n\\nTheir quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of France, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds.\\n\\nDefending champions, the United States, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner, but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover.\\n\\nThe British quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men's team.\\n\\nFraser-Pryce, like Bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay.\\n\\nIn other final action on the last day of the championships, France's Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold.\\n\\nGermany's Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women's javelin after five previous silvers, while Kenya's Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men's 1500m final.\\n\\nKiprop's compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women's 800m.\\n\\nBolt's final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium.\\n\\nThere was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia's new laws, which make \"the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors\" a criminal offense.\\n\\nShe later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the next major sports event in Russia.\\n\\n

What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?\\n\\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.\\n\\n\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\"\\n\\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.\\n\\nTranscript: Read Obama's full remarks\\n\\nSyrian crisis: Latest developments\\n\\nU.N. inspectors leave Syria\\n\\nObama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.\\n\\n\"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.\\n\\nBut who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.\\n\\nTop U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.\\n\\nBritish and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.\\n\\nThe inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.\\n\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.\\n\\n\"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said.\\n\\nHe noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\"\\n\\nBergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.\\n\\nObama: 'This menace must be confronted'\\n\\nObama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.\\n\\nSome global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

\n3  los angeles a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada. i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case, stancheva told in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkhart is role in it. stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said. stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. burkhart, a 24 year old german national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities. stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of 2010. i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression, she said. burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing. prosecutors said his rage against americans, triggered by his mother is arrest last week, motivated his campaign of terror with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities. burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff is deputies to hold him up. the district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre. this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community, los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans. carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a 2.85 million bond and surrender his german passport. it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany. the worst arson sprees in the city is history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said. no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach 3 million, authorities said. cooley called it almost attempted murder, because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire, cooley said. if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant. in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings, a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep. investigator edward nordskog is affidavit detailed burkhart is behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. while in the audience, the defendant burkhart began yelling in an angry manner, f k all americans. the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy u.s. marshals, nordskog wrote. dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the 53 year old german woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. it is my opinion that the defendant is criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible, nordskog wrote. a search of burkhart is hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september, 2011, the investigator said. it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states, nordskog wrote. burkhart is mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24. meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.
